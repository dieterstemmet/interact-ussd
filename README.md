# InteractUSSD

## Overview
**InteractUSSD** is a web-based tool designed to simulate USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) interactions. This project aims to provide a simple, intuitive platform for users to explore and understand the capabilities of USSD technology through direct interaction with a simulated environment.

## Features
- **Direct MSISDN and Location Input**: Users can set their mobile number (MSISDN) and location directly through input fields, reflecting real-world USSD session settings.
- **Dynamic USSD Sessions**: Simulate various USSD interactions, including menu navigation, account services, and bundle management.
- **Language Switching**: Toggle between English and Spanish to demonstrate USSD's versatility in different linguistic contexts.
- **Interactive Demos**: Engage with simulations like "Spin and Win" to showcase potential USSD applications.
